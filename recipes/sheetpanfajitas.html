    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Sheet Pan Chicken Fajitas are a regular in our dinner rotation! These easy fajitas are booming with flavor, they’re a breeze to throw together, and clean up couldn’t be easier. They’re a crowd favorite with my family and for pot-luck occasions also! I love that they can be eatan in so many ways. My family loves tortillas, fajita bowls or nacho style.</p>
    <p>Even though these baked chicken fajitas aren’t served fresh after being seared in a hot cast iron, they are still packed with flavor! I usually make a double batch because they are great leftovers and easy to heat up! This is definitely the perfect lazy dinner because its so easy and takes barley any time to prep and toss in. I usually have at least one lazy dinner a week so I usually keep these ingridients on hand.It has all those delicious southwestern flavors and only requires minimal effort. Lazy Monday night meal here we come.</p>
