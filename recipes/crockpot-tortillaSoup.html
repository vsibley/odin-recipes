    <h2>Discription:</h2>
    <p>When its cold outside everyone loves a hot bowl of soup. But in our house, there is nothing that soothes the soul and can warm you up (we mean figuratively and literally) like a big bowl of chicken tortilla soup. The kick from all the flavors from the chili powder and the fire roasted tomatoes gives what could be a boring normal bowl of soup, a total makeover.</p>
    <p>We pack in more protein by adding black beans, corn, bell peppers and canned fire-roasted tomatoes, because we love smokiness. We like to top it off with some avocado, cilantro, tortilla strips, and sour cream, but really any of your favorite nacho toppings work great!</p>
