    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      When its cold outside everyone loves a hot bowl of soup. But in our house,
      there is nothing that soothes the soul and can warm you up (we mean
      figuratively and literally) like a big bowl of chicken tortilla soup. The
      kick from all the flavors from the chili powder and the fire roasted
      tomatoes gives what could be a boring normal bowl of soup, a total
      makeover.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pack in more protein by adding black beans, corn, bell peppers and
      canned fire-roasted tomatoes, because we love smokiness. We like to top it
      off with some avocado, cilantro, tortilla strips, and sour cream, but
      really any of your favorite nacho toppings work great!

      <li>
        In a large slow cooker, combine chicken, black beans, corn, peppers,
        onion, fire-roasted tomatoes, cilantro, garlic, cumin, chili powder,
        salt, and chicken broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shred chicken with a fork, then top soup with Monterey Jack and cover to

        Meanwhile, make tortilla crisps: In a large skillet over medium heat,
        heat oil. Add tortilla strips and cook until crispy and golden, 3
