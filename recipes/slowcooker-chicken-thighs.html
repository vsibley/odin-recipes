    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Using a slow-cooker is one of our favorite, easy ways to prepare chicken thighs. The gentle heat helps ensure that the thighs will be tender and juicy. AND the sauce, you'll be happy to know, doesn't need any precooking. It just gets poured right in and forgotten about until dinner time.</p>
    
    <p>Searing the chicken thighs may seem like an annoying step, but trust us, it's worth it. Not only does it get the chicken skin nice and crispy (because it does lose some crispiness in the slow cooker), but it also caramelizes the fat, adding a ton more flavor. If you don't want to do it, that's totally fine. You can just throw the chicken in the slow cooker. </p>
